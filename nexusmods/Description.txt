[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Introduction[/b][/size][/font]
You became strong with the Dark Side. Now everything that touches your skin becomes fully charged immediately.
Your immense power radiates from you, keeping all batteries fully charged all the time.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
The new version of the mod has two primarily features.
It charges all batteries placed in the world to their maximum value and prevents them from being drained. You can connect as many devices as you like to a single battery.
Second feature, your currently held item (selected item in hotbar) and your equipped gear becomes fully charged.
Both features are enabled per default and can be toggles off/on with hotkeys. The Infinite Battery Charge is bound to the key [b]F8[/b] while the Infinite Gear Charge it togglebar with [b]F7[/b].
Since v2.3.0 the mod has an option to enable infinite gear and held item energy to all players.
See the [b]Mod Configuration[/b] section below for details how to change hotkeys and disable features per default.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Hints[/b][/size][/font]
[list][*]The changed batteries charge isn't instantly visible, it might take a while until game updates the visuals. You can pick up the battery to see that it's full.
[*]When equipped Gear and Held Item is drained, the mod will try to replenish it with best allowed energy. If it's allowed it will be filled with laser energy.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=1]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install the mod manually.[/size]
1. Follow the instruction on the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/abioticfactor/mods/35]UE4SS for Abiotic Factor[/url] page to download and install latest UE4SS from there.
2. After use the [b]Manual Download[/b] button in [i]Files[/i] tab of this mod to download the mod as a zip file.
4. Unzip/extract the content of mod's zip ([b]UnlimitedPower[/b] folder) into the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\[/i]
[size=2]Make sure you don't create a new folder while extracting! If you do just move the content to the destination after.[/size]
[size=2]Whole mod path should be like this: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\UnlimitedPower\[/i][/size]
[size=2]Steam example: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\UnlimitedPower\[/i][/size]
5. Verify that you have installed the mod correctly.
The mod directory should contain a [b]Scripts[/b] folder and an [b]enabled.txt[/b] file.
[size=2][i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\UnlimitedPower\Scripts\[/i]
[i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\UnlimitedPower\enabled.txt[/i][/size]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Mod Configuration[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]All the configurations are happening in the [b]main.lua[/b][/size]
1. Navigate into mod's directory->scripts to find the [b]main.lua[/b] file.
[size=2]It should be under: (game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\UnlimitedPower\scripts\[/size]
2. Open the [b]main.lua[/b] with Notepad or any other text editor.
3. Under the [b]Configurations[/b] section in the [i]main.lua[/i] you will find a subsection for each feature.
[size=2]Each feature has a variable for the primary key, modifier keys and an "on/off" (true/false) variable.[/size]
[b]Hotkey[/b]
[size=2]Each hotkey is a combination of the primary "Key" and "KeyModifiers", modifiers are support keys like SHIFT, CTRL, ALT.
UE4SS doc contains possible [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/blob/main/docs/lua-api/table-definitions/key.md]Key[/url] (click link) values and [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/blob/main/docs/lua-api/table-definitions/key.md]ModifierKey [/url](click link) with examples.[/size]
[b]On/Off[/b]
[size=2]Both features are On (true) per default, if you want change the default state of the feature, simply change it's value from [b]true[/b] to [b]false[/b].[/size]
Example:
[code]InfiniteBatteryCharge = false
InfiniteGearCharge = false
[/code]
[size=2]If you want the state of v2.1.0 when the mod would charge [b]only[/b] your Held Item, you can set [b]ApplyToHeldItemOnly = true[/b][/size]
Since v2.3.0 you have the option to enable [b]InfiniteGearChargeForAll[/b], it will apply infinite gear and held item energy to all players. It respects the ApplyToHeldItemOnly variable setting as well.
4. Don't forget to save your changes!

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]How to use[/b][/size][/font]
[list][*]The mod is enabled per default!
[*]You can press toggle key F8 (default key) to Disable/Enable Infinite Battery Charge,
[*]Toggle key F7 (default key) to Disable/Enable Infinite Gear Charge (it also charges the Held Item)
[*]Changed state of each feature will be printed to the game's chat. But it should be only visible to you.
[*]You can toggle the mod's features any time, even if the chat is not visible, even in main menu.
[*]You can set [b]InfiniteGearChargeForAll = true[/b] in [i]main.lua[/i] to enable infinite energy for all players
[/list]
[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Dedicated Server[/b][/size][/font]
If the mod is running on a Dedicated Server, the hotkeys will of course not work and no text will be shown in chat or display.
As long the [b]InfiniteGearChargeForAll[/b] variable is set NOT set to [b]true[/b], only the [b]first[/b] player on the server will have infinite charge in his gear and held item.
