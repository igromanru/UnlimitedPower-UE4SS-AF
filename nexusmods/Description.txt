[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
The mod is enabled per default, but can be toggled off/on with the hotkey. Default hotkey is [b]F8[/b], but it can be changed in the [i]main.lua[/i] (see Configuration section below).
While the mod is active, it sets the charge of all placed batteries to their maximum value and prevents them from being drained.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install the mod manually.[/size]
1. Download the latest version of RE-UE4SS from it's [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases]Release[/url] section. You need the [b]UE4SS_v{version nummber}.zip [/b]
2. Unzip the content of the zip archive into the following location: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i]
[size=2]It should be at the location of the [b]AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping.exe[/b] !
For Steam users it might be something like this: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i][/size]
3. Now use the [b]Manual Download[/b] button in [i]Files[/i] tab to download the mod as a zip file as well.
4. Unzip/extract the content of mod's zip ([b]UnlimitedPower[/b] folder) into the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\[/i]
[size=2]Whole mod path should be like this: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\UnlimitedPower\[/i]
Steam example: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\UnlimitedPower\
[/i][/size]5. Done, you can change mod's hotkey, if you want (see below).

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Mod Configuration[/b][/size][/font]
Currently the mod has only the option to change the toggle key. Default is [b]F8[/b].
1. Navigate deep into mods directory to find the [b]main.lua[/b] file.
[size=2]It should be in: (game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\UnlimitedPower\scripts\[/size]
2. Open the [b]main.lua[/b] with Notepad or any other text editor.
3. You can modify the [b]ToggleModKey[/b] and [b]ToggleModKeyModifiers[/b] variables.
[size=2]You can find examples and possible Key and ModifierKey values in the UE4SS documentation.
See: [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/blob/main/docs/lua-api/table-definitions/key.md]Key[/url] and [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/blob/main/docs/lua-api/table-definitions/modifierkey.md]ModifierKey[/url][/size]
4. Don't forget to save your changes.

[list]
[*]The mod is enabled per default!
[*]When you press mod's toggle key (Default F8) the mod will print to game's chat it's new state (Enabled/Disabled).  
[*]Mod's chat message should only be visible to you. (untested)
[*]You can toggle the mod any time, even if the chat is not visible.
[*]While the mod is enabled all batteries placed in the world will be held at maximum charge
[*]The mod was developed and tested in Singleplayer, but might work if you're the host of the game (untested)

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Start the mod disabled[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]My idea was that anyone who wants to use the mod doesn't want to forget to turn it on during the game and then be left with empty batteries in a fight.
But if you want to use it just occasionally, here is the way to keep it disabled at the start of the game.[/size]
1. Follow the steps 1. to 2. in the [b]Mod Configuration[/b] section above
2. In the [b]main.lua[/b] find the line that contains "local IsModEnabled = " and change it's value simply to [b]false[/b].
[code]local IsModEnabled = false[/code]
