[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Introduction[/b][/size][/font]
You became strong with the Dark Side. Now everything you touch is fully charged immediately.
Your immense power radiates from you, keeping all batteries fully charged all the time.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
The new version of the mod has two primarily features.
It charges all batteries placed in the world to their maximum value and prevents them from being drained. You can connect as many devices as you like to a single battery.
Second feature, your currently held item (selected item in hotbar) becomes fully charged.
Both features are enabled per default and can be toggles off/on with hotkeys. The Infinite Battery Charge is bound to the key [b]F8[/b] while the Infinite Held Item Charge it togglebar with [b]F7[/b].
See the [b]Mod Configuration[/b] section below for details how to change hotkeys and disable features per default.

[size=2]It should be at the location of the [b]AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping.exe[/b] !
For Steam users it might be something like this: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i][/size]
3. Now use the [b]Manual Download[/b] button in [i]Files[/i] tab to download the mod as a zip file as well.
4. Unzip/extract the content of mod's zip ([b]UnlimitedPower[/b] folder) into the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\[/i]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Mod Configuration[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]All the configurations are happening in the [b]main.lua[/b][/size]

[size=2]Each feature has a variable for the primary key, modifier keys and an "on/off" (true/false) variable.[/size]
[b]Hotkey[/b]
[size=2]Each hotkey is a combination of the primary "Key" and "KeyModifiers", modifiers are support keys like SHIFT, CTRL, ALT.
